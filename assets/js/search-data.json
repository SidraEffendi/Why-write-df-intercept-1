            "content": "Why write df[intercept]= 1 in linear regression model of python? . Linear regression is basic type of predictive analysis. In a linear regression model we are trying to find the best fitted line for a scatter plot and for simple linear regression the line is represented as . $$ hat{y}= b1x+b0 $$ . where, b1 is the slope and b0 is the intercept . . Let&#39;s take an example where we want to predict the price of a house on the basis of how many bedrooms it has. Then the variable we want to predict, which is price, is represented by y and x is the no.of bedrooms in the house. In this context, the change in price, when one more bedrrom is added to the house, will be represented by value b1. Our intercept b0, is the value of the house when it has no bedrooms at all (you can crash in the bathtub). Now that we have our interpretations down, lets dive into some code. . To find value of the parameters b1 and b0 of the best fitted line, we write a simple three line code in python. . df[&#39;intercept&#39;] = 1 # df is dataframe containing our data #performing linear regression lm = sm.OLS(df[&#39;Price&#39;], df[[&#39;intercept&#39;,&#39;bedrooms&#39;]]) results = lm.fit() results.summary() . Note here that we added a column &#39;intercept&#39; to our data, before performing linear regression and set its value to 1, which might cause some confusion as to why we have to write this exact same line of code everytime, before performing linear regression? What if I skip this line of code? What if intercept is set to a value other than 1? . Explanation: . In the linear regression model, OLS finds &quot;weight * predictor&quot; for each term used in the regression. This means that if we skip intercept variable, which looks like this: . lm = sm.OLS(df[&#39;price&#39;],df[&#39;bedrooms&#39;]) . Then, OLS will see the equation as: . $$y = b1*x$$ . OLS algorithm will now proceed to find b1 and leave out b0 because there is only one predictor x given to it for which it will calculate the weight b1. This way, without the intercept, the line is forced to always pass by the origin (0, 0) and we never get the predictive relationship we are seeking between price and the no.of bedrooms, as per the fitted model. So, it is often quoted that,initializing the intercept should never be skipped, unless there is gaurantee that the linear approximation of the linear regression model either by some theoretical or any other reasons is forced to go through the origin. . Since we are now clear we want value of intercept b0 , we add a column for it in our database. Now, OLS sees that we want value of weight = b0 but then we also have to have a predictor for equation to be complete. Since we want the value of intercept unaltered, we simply multiply it by 1, that is, weight (= b0) * predictor( = 1) and it suffices our need. So, we give OLS, the equation: . $$y = b1*x + b0*1$$ . Now, our linear regression model knows it has to find the value of both b1 and b0. . Note: In R language, intercept is included anyway without initialization. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
