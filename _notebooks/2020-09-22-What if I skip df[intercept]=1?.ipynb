The variable we want to predict is the **price**, which is represented by **y** and **x** means the **no.of bedrooms** in the house. In this context, the change in price, when we add one more bedroom to the house, is represented by value **b1** and our intercept **b0** is the value of the house when it has no bedrooms at all (you can crash in the bathtub). Now that we have our interpretations down let's dive into some code."
